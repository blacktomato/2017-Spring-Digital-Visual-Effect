Assignments and Project of the course Digital Visual Effect, Spring 2017

## Project 1: High Dynamic Range Imaging

High Dynamic Range (HDR) images have large dynamic ranges which correspond to irradiance value of a scene in physical world. This project implemented a program to assemble an HDR image from a list of images (Fig. 1.1) with identical scene but with different exposure times.

## Project 2: Image Stitching

Image stitching is useful when creating an image with larger field of view (FOV) by stitching a set of images altogether. A common application of image stitching is to create a panorama, which has a wide-horizontal-angle view. In this project, we implemented an end-to-end algorithm, with input as a set of images, and with the output being the panorama of these images.



## Project 3: MatchMove

Matchmove is a technique to insert computer generated imagery (CGI) seamlessly into a video sequence. The idea of matchmove is to extract and estimate camera parameters from the video. In this project, we shot a video and inserted CGI into the video sequence with Blender and After Effect.
